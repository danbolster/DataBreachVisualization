<h1>Data Breach Visualization</h1><p>This visualization was made for a final project in my 'Web, Data, & Design' Class. It utilizes a 'circle pack' style, and allows the user to view data breaches that occurred, separated in different categories in order to better show patterns and trends that occur in data breaches in a large scale.</p>
